3- Creating Measures
4- Dashboarding

### Note
For Hospitality industry weekend is considered on Friday and Saturday

## Important observations
1- From this dashboard we can come to a conclusion that this hotel chain is not using dynamic pricing so to increase its revenue we can have dynamic pricing based on weekday/weekend.
2- To incease the booking from Hotels own website they can provide some discount coupons.
3- For the hotels whoose occupancy is very low we can see that the average rating for them is also very low, so in that case they have to look for the feedbacks by customers and then analyze it further to increase the services so as to increase its rating.
